NUI (Native User Interface)
=============
NUI is a tiny C GUI library to create common interfaces using the OS native API.

Build instructions
-------------
NUI uses the well known CMake build system. Just run CMake to generate the MakeFile of your choice and build the library! You can choose to build samples/ during the process if you want to.

Samples will then be available in the bin/ folder and the nui static library into the lib/ folder.
